# High-Score
Handles high scores for a game with a simple python module

## Usage
In main.py, a sample data file name handler is shown, feel free to substitute your own that works with your file structure. The high score handling class requires a full path name, not a relative one to function, my file handler should work across multiple operating systems.

Everything should just work if you download and extract to wherever you want.
